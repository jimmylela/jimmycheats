	tcpdump -nnqi 0.0 dst x.x.x.x  (better quick and dirty)

tcpdump -nnqi 0.0 host x.x.x.x | grep "> x.x.x.x"

tcpdump -nnvvvi 0.0:pnnn host x.x.x.x -s0 -C200 -w /var/tmp/`date +%Y%m%d`_filename.pcap

tcpdump -nnvvvi 0.0:pnnn host x.x.x.x -s0 -C00 -W10 -w /var/tmp/`date +%Y%m%d`_filename.pcap  (rotating capture)






-quick and dirty see what IPs are hitting
tcpdump -nnqs0 -i any host x.x.x.x
tcpdump -nnqs0 -i any host x.x.x.x | grep "> x.x.x.x"  (see only one direction)


-options
	-s0 = packet size limit 0 (infinite)
	-nn = no name resolution for hosts (first n) nor ports (second n)
	-q = quiet output
	-vvv = verbosisimoest
	-i = interface (0.0 = all)
		:nnn after interface = highest level of logging for F5 dissector and include 
		:p after interface = include back end or front end load balanced connections using F5 dissector
	-C = capture size limit in megabytes
	-W number of files to create before rotating
	-w = write output to file


- see quickly what IPs are talking to a virtual server (traffic on a VIP)

	tcpdump -nnqs0 -i any host x.x.x.x   (nnqs0 = don't resolve IPs or ports (nn), less info (q), and no size limit on packet (s0), i = interface)
		
	tmsh tcpdump -nnqs0 -i any host x.x.x.x | grep "> x.x.x.x"  -- only include the hits going to the virtual server, not both ways (easier to read)


-DO IT IN WINDOWS!
