# New Centos 8 Server Initial Setup

Geared mainly towards hosted VM, which will have networking, storage, and maybe some other functions set up automatically upon creation

## Create swap file (if needed, Azure VMs are created with no swap file, which causes problems including semanage failures)
sudo fallocate -l 1g /mnt/resource/swap1g
sudo chmod 600 /mnt/resource/swap1g
sudo mkswap /mnt/resource/swap1g
sudo swapon /mnt/resource/swap1g

## Install semanage to manage Selinux
sudo yum provides selenix  
sudo yum install policycoreutils-python-utils -y

## Management
Assuming networking is set up and 22 or another port is already allowed inbound

sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh.sshd_config.bak.YYYYMMDD

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
  add line under '#Port 22' saying "Port 1914"

sudo semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 1914

systemctl restart sshd

Edit vm firewall rules with cloud provider
